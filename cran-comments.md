R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.3 and R development 
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This is a re-submission of the same package version with a fix for 
a badly formed URL in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file.

This submission adds many new functions, and fixes some bugs.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
